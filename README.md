# Aquarium
An aquarium you can run in your mac terminal!

    (NOTE:  Written for mac terminal in Python 2.7.1
            Need "termcolor" python module to run)

Just run the file in python and watch your aquarium go!
Complete with a semi-realistic ecosystem food chain hierarchy and agent-based schools of fish.

    aquarium.py         --  Always the same aquarium, but easier to mess around with if you want to try
    aquarium_random.py  --  Randomizes the aquarium and fish ecosystem every time, so it's never the same.
