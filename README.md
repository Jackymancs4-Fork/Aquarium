# Aquarium
An aquarium you can run in your mac terminal!

    (NOTE:  Written for mac terminal in Python 2.7.1
            Need "termcolor" python module to run)

Just run the file in python and watch your aquarium go!  Complete with a semi-realistic ecosystem food chain hierarchy and agent-based schools of fish.

Automatically adjusts to the size of your terminal, so you can have any aquarium shape you want (tall aquarium off to the side, broad aquarium below your work windows, or just have it fulscreen).

    aquarium.py                 --  Randomizes the aquarium and fish ecosystem every time, so it's never the same.
    aquarium._playground.py     --  Always the same aquarium, but easier to mess around with if you want to try


Here's a screenshot from aquarium.py running fullscreen:

Since aquarium adjusts to your terminal window size, you can have a shallow or skinny aquarium if you want some company while you work:
